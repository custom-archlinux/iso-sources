# Custom Arch Linux Iso Sources
This repo contains only files and folders that are different from the official archiso.

These files and folders are located in the ./custom folder.

# Before building a custom ISO
To build the custom Iso you need to install **archiso** package:

```
sudo pacman -S archiso
```

Next, check out the archiso.md and use the same version of archiso.

If needed, downgrade to the right version:

```
downgrade archiso
```

and choose the correct one.

# Build
Simply run the **buildIso.sh** script in root:
```
sudo sh buildIso.sh
```

and go drink a coffee!
